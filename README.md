# The Online Centre for Religious Studies

This is a trial version of the OCRS website. Once I am happy with the overall code and structure, I will aim to upload the site to a hosting service, most likely one.com as they are very low priced and I am very poor.

The basic design echoes a free template that I found on Wordpress, but the actual code is my own - everything was done from scratch.
