It is increasingly important for people to be religiously literate; the reality of living in a multicultural society, where many worldviews interact, means that we need understanding and knowledge if we are to live together peacefully. We are also enriched by the millennia of shared human experience that is encoded within faiths, traditions, and worldviews, and stand to benefit by its study.
<br><br>
Established in 2016, the centre’s goals are to promote and facilitate the academic study of religion for a wide and diverse audience. It is not always possible to gain an accurate picture of unfamiliar traditions by following news stories and listening to the loudest voices – if we hope to understand, we need to reflect clearly on both the academic study of religion, and the lived experiences of actual adherents.
<br><br>
Our goals are to provide knowledge, foster understanding, and promote dialogue. We plan to offer online courses that investigate a range of worldviews, and hope to develop this offering as we move forward. The focus is on clarity and simplicity wherever possible, and we welcome comments and contributions on how we can improve the service.
<br><br>
We will also provide a range of free learning resources, including information sheets for GCSE students in the UK, free short courses, reading lists, quotations, and more. We recognise that the current world religions paradigm is problematic, and that it helps reinforce politicised stereotypes. It is the aim of the centre to challenge these viewpoints via innovative online courses that embrace a critical study of religion, while also offering a supportive environment for dialogue with faith groups and communities. We are currently exploring ways to improve our course offerings to better reflect this philosophy and welcome input or advice.

The OCRS is based in Somerset, United Kingdom.
